    <p style=" background-color: red;">As defined in the specification, the margins between two block boxes are
        what creates separation between the elements. We see this with a very simple 
        layout of two paragraphs, to which I have added a border. The default browser
        stylesheet adds spacing between the paragraphs by way of adding a margin to
        the top and bottom.</p>
